Robomaster is an international robot competition held by DJI that aimed to train and inspire engineer students from all over the world. This simulation project is designed to be a training program that simulates the situation of the real Robomaster competition. 

There is one team on each side that the main objective is to destroy the opponents' base or robots or both and protect their own units(make sure the health point of their own base is higher. A player can choose to control a robot such as a hero, standard,  engineer or a drone. A drone needs two players to manipulate. A pilot and a gunner.

Standard and hero have the shooting ability that project 17mm or 40mm rounds which can damage opponents' health point if it hits any armor plate. At the beginning of every game, standard and hero robots need to get in the supply area in order refill ammo because they all start with an empty magazine. Once the health point drops to zero, the robot loses mobility and considered as "dead". 

Robomaster Simulation supports up to 10 players in the multiplayer mode. Currently, this program can only run on the local network.
